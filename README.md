## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Public Server

Use `npm run public` for a dev server, that also can be reached from outside of your network. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
If you have SSL certificates be sure to put them in a ssl/ folder in the root of the project so it also uses SSL.
